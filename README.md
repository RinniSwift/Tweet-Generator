# Tweet Generator

This is a repo that randomly generates tweets using Markov models.

## [sample.py](https://github.com/RinniSwift/Tweet-Generator/blob/master/sample.py)
*The above file demonstrates:*
1. how to random a word from a text by the possibility of how often they show up in the text.

## [python_quote.py](https://github.com/RinniSwift/Tweet-Generator/blob/master/python_quote.py)
*The above file demonstrates:*
1. returns random word from array that contains words
2. returns the rearangment of users terminal input into a string (using Fisher-Yates shuffle)
3. returns reversed arrangment of users terminal input

## [dictionary_words.py](https://github.com/RinniSwift/Tweet-Generator/blob/master/dictionary_words.py)
*The above file demonstrates:*
1. returns random sentence with n amount of words (from the terminal input) from the dictionary file on our computer
3. split words from a file into an array
4. returns a plain string to a sentence format with capital letter at the front and full stop at the end

## [histogram_word_count.py](https://github.com/RinniSwift/Tweet-Generator/blob/master/histogram_word_count.py)
*The above file demonstrates:*
1. turns a text file to a list of words excluding punctuations
1. returns a histogram that displays the word and the number of times it appeared in a given text file (*dictionary, lists of lists, lists of tuples, list of counts*)
2. returns number of words that are unique in the text file
3. returns the amount of times a given word has appeared in the text file
4. returns the most frequent word used in the text file


## [cowsay.py](https://github.com/RinniSwift/Tweet-Generator/blob/master/cowsay.py)
*The above file demonstrates*
1. a script that imitates cowsay
2. how to format strings with a given input


## [autocomplete.py](https://github.com/RinniSwift/Tweet-Generator/blob/master/autocomplete.py)
*The above file demonstrates*
1. how to return complete words that start with a given letter or letter sequence
